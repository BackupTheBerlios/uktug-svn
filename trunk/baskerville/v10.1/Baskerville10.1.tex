\section{Events}
\subsection{EuroTex 2009}
EuroTeX 2009 takes place this year in the Hague, the Netherlands, on August 31 through September 4, and the conference will focus on educational uses of \TeX, such as manuals, presentations and teaching materials. The conference will be in English.

The fee for UK-TUG members is \euro350, which includes everything except the excursion day (which costs \euro75). In particular it includes accommodation and meals. If you book and pay before February 1st there is a \euro100 discount.

The official website is \href{http://www.ntg.nl/EuroTeX2009/index.html}{www.ntg.nl/EuroTeX2009}.

\subsection{Bacho\TeX\ 2009}
Bacho\TeX\ 2009 is the XVIIth Polish \TeX\ Users Group Conference.

As usual it will be held at the traditional TeXies' and GUST meeting place, Bachotek near Brodnica, in the north-east of Poland, from April 29 until May 3, 2009 inclusive.

The conference aims to get a glimpse of the future, and the title is:
\begin{center} ``\textit{\TeX: at a turning point, or at the crossroads?}'' \end{center}

The community is putting a lot of effort and thought into possible strategies for promoting and developing \TeX\ and related products for the foreseeable future, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item \TeX\, and \TeX-based engines
\item enhanced graphics engines
\item new or improved macro packages
\item user interfaces
\item new fonts
\end{itemize}

Work progresses in many different directions, and thus there is clearly hope for an ever better future, even though the more pessimistic may wonder whether \TeX\ represents an evolutionary dead-end.

In this context the feedback between users and developers of new tools and engines is immensely important -- it might decide whether within a few years we will be looking back at today as a successful turning point or as a bad decision at the crossroads of \TeX's history.

Some say that they have never believed that conference themes/mottos have any impact on submissions anyway. The organisers of Bacho\TeX\ think otherwise. There is no restriction on the content of presentations but those that are user-centric and oriented towards the future of \TeX\ with special emphasis on the needs, hopes and dangers are preferred.

Proposals (abstracts) should be e-mailed to the Program Committee: \href{mailto:papers-2009@gust.org.pl}{papers-2009@gust.org.pl}. Bogus\l{}aw Jackowski has been appointmed chairman.

Especially welcome are proposals for \TeX-related tutorials or introductions. Contact the organisers if you have suggestions for tutorials or workshops by others than yourself or about specific topics.

The deadline for abstracts and other proposals is March 8th. The deadline for final papers will soon be published at the conference web site: \href{http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/2009/main-en.html?set_language=en}{www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2009}

Exhausted TeXies will get a chance to recover their intellectual powers during nightly musical sessions, usually at a bonfire. Participate by bringing your own instruments (and voices)! Nature fans will have the opportunity to enjoy the unspoiled features of the Bachotek lake and surrounding woods. The conference could also be a family event -- the conference site is an enclosed area with a safe and attractive playing ground for children and parents alike.

\noindent \textbf{Call for TeX Pearls} \\
The organisers are seeking to continue the tradition of ``The Pearls of TeX Programming''.
Here, briefly, is what is wanted:
\begin{itemize}
\item short \TeX, MF or MP macro(s)
\item results must be useful, and the solution not obvious
\item easy to explain:  10 minutes at most
\end{itemize}

If you have something that fits the bill, please consider submitting a proposal. If you know of somebody's work that does the same, please let us know, and we will contact that person.  Other details and previously collected Pearls can be found at 
\href{http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/pearls/}{www.gust.org.pl/projects/pearls}

\section{\LaTeX\ Hints \& Tips}
\textbf{Currency Symbols} \\
Standard keyboards contain the dollar sign (\$), which, of course, is a special symbol in \TeX, so needs to be prefaced with a backslash or oblique: \textbackslash \$. This symbol works properly in both text mode and math mode.

Keyboards also have a pound sign (£), the use of which requires the package \texttt{inputenc}. Again there is a standard command \textbackslash \texttt{pounds}, which renders as \pounds. This symbol works properly in both text mode and math mode.

Additionally, standard \LaTeX\ contains two commands for these signs: \\
\indent \textbackslash \texttt{textdollar} which renders as \textdollar, and \\
\indent \textbackslash \texttt{textsterling} which renders as \textsterling.

The euro has its own package, \texttt{eurosym}, which contains these commands:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l }
\toprule
\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{\LaTeX}  \\
\midrule
\geneuro        & \textbackslash \texttt{geneuro} \\
\geneuronarrow  & \textbackslash \texttt{geneuronarrow} \\
\geneurowide    & \textbackslash \texttt{geneurowide} \\
\officialeuro   & \textbackslash \texttt{officialeuro} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
All of these symbols are generated using the ``C'' character of the current body font. The package also contains the command \textbackslash \texttt{euro} which maps to \textbackslash \texttt{officialeuro} but can altered using a package option.

% --------------------------------------------------------
% Change footnote marker to symbols instead of numbers.

The \texttt{textcomp} package includes these symbols:

\footnotetext[2]{The denarius was a Roman coin. The dinar is a descendant of the denarius and is used, or was formerly used, by several countries. However, I couldn't discover any country using this symbol. Serbia, for example, use the cyrillic De (\textcyrrm{D}) letter for the dinar.}
\footnotetext[3]{This symbol resembles a beta ($\beta$) but I belive it to be more akin to the German Eszett (\ss). It is possibly a symbol for the schilling, the pre-euro currency of Austria.}

  UK-TUG but excluding:
\begin{enumerate}
\item fines;
\item costs of unsuccessfully defending criminal prosecutions for offences
  arising out of the fraud, dishonesty or wilful or reckless misconduct of the
  Committee member or other Officer;

\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item No Committee member may be paid or receive any other benefit for being a
  Committee member.
\item \label{ConflictOfInterest} A Committee member must absent himself or herself from any discussions of

  of the time specified for the start of the meeting the members present at that
  time shall constitute the quorum for that meeting.
\item \label{ElecQuor} If the business of a special general meeting is to be conducted 
  by electronic means
  then no quorum shall be required for the discussion of any item. A quorum as specified

  entitled to represent the organisation or that his or her authority has been
  revoked. UK-TUG shall not be required to consider whether the nominee has been
  properly appointed by the organisation.
\end{enumerate}
