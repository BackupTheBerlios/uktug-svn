\section{Editorial}
Welcome to the revived \BK. \BK\ was for many years the journal of \ukt\ and archived copies are available through our website. The \ukt\ committee have decided to start anew publication of \BK\ and I have been co-opted onto the committee as editor. This is the first new issue. Since the purpose of \TeX\ is to produce ``marks on paper'' \BK\ has been printed and posted out; though the PDF version has been emailed out and is also available on the web.

The journal is named after a serif typeface designed in 1757 by John Baskerville. Previous issues of \BK\ used the Baskerville font but this issue uses the default \textit{Computer Modern} font.

This particular issue is somewhat light in content. The quality of future issues will depend on \textit{you}, the membership of \ukt. I do not intent to create all the content myself, and welcome contributions on matters relevant to \TeX\ or \ukt.

I think that a newsletter is central to the well-being of a user group such as ours, and I look forwards to hearing your comments on this issue.

Bacho\TeX\ 2009 is the XVII\textsuperscript{th} Polish \TeX\ Users Group Conference which took place at the traditional \TeX ies' and GUST meeting place, Bachotek near Brodnica, in the north-east of Poland, from 29 April until 3 May 2009 inclusive.

The conference aimed to get a glimpse of the future, and the title was:
\begin{center} ``\textit{\TeX: at a turning point, or at the crossroads?}'' \end{center}

Bogus\l{}aw Jackowski is chairman of the Program Committee which can be contacted at:

\subsection{Call for \TeX\ Pearls}
GUST, the organisers of Bacho\TeX\, are seeking to continue the tradition of ``The Pearls of \TeX\ Programming''.
Briefly, Pearls are
\begin{itemize}
\item short \TeX, \texttt{MetaFont} or \texttt{MetaPost} macros
\item contain code that is easy to explain and preferably not obvious
\item obscure oddities, exhibiting weird \TeX\ behaviour -- dirty and risky tricks and traps are also welcome
\item not necessarily useful or serious
\end{itemize}

Pearls are collected throughout the year by Pawe\l\ Jackowski, contact:
\begin{center}

The British Society for the History of Mathematics is hosting a workshop on the relationship between mathematics and fiction on 30-31 May 2009 at Rewley House, Oxford. The workshop will include readings and interviews with writers, talks about the uses of mathematics in fiction, and opportunities for discussion and debate.

One of the contributors is Donald Knuth, the creator of \TeX. He is Professor Emeritus of the Art of Computer Programming at Stanford University and author of the seminal multi-volume work ``The Art of Computer Programming''. Knuth will be talking about his novel ``Surreal Numbers'', published in 1974 and still available on Amazon.

The workshop is organised by
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tony Mann (\href{mailto:A.Mann@gre.ac.uk}{A.Mann@gre.ac.uk})
	\item Noel-Ann Bradshaw (\href{mailto:N.Bradshaw@gre.ac.uk}{N.Bradshaw@gre.ac.uk})

% \textbf{Currency Symbols} \\

\section{Currency Symbols in \LaTeX}

\AUTHOR{Jonathan Webley}

\subsection{The Dollar and the Pound}
Standard keyboards contain the dollar sign (\$), which, of course, is a special symbol in \TeX, so needs to be prefaced with a backslash or oblique: \textbackslash \$. This symbol works properly in both text mode and math mode.

Keyboards also have a pound sign (£), the use of which requires the package \texttt{inputenc}. Additionally, there is a standard command \textbackslash \texttt{pounds}, which renders as \pounds. This symbol works properly in both text mode and math mode.

Additionally, standard \LaTeX\ contains two commands for these signs:

\textbackslash \texttt{textdollar} which renders as \textdollar, and

\textbackslash \texttt{textsterling} which renders as \textsterling.

\subsection{The Euro}

The European Commission specified a euro logo with exact proportions and colours. Whilst the Commission intended the logo to be a prescribed glyph shape, many font designers created their own variants.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \caption{\textit{Construction of the euro symbol}}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{euro.jpg}
\end{figure}

According to the European Commission:
\begin{quote}
``Inspiration for the \euro\ symbol itself came from the Greek epsilon ($\epsilon$)  a reference to the cradle of European civilisation  and the first letter of the word Europe, crossed by two parallel lines to certify the stability of the euro.''
\end{quote}

An approximation to the euro symbol can be created on a typewriter by typing a capital ``C'', backspacing and overstriking it with the equal (``='') sign.

On many computers the euro symbol can be obtained with the \texttt{<ctrl>+<alt>+e} keystrokes.

In \LaTeX\ the euro has its own package, \texttt{eurosym}, which contains these commands:

\medskip

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l l }
\toprule
\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{\LaTeX}  \\
\midrule
\geneuro        & \textbackslash \texttt{geneuro} \\
\geneuronarrow  & \textbackslash \texttt{geneuronarrow} \\
\geneurowide    & \textbackslash \texttt{geneurowide} \\
\officialeuro   & \textbackslash \texttt{officialeuro} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\medskip

All of these symbols are generated using the ``C'' character of the current body font. The package also contains the command \textbackslash \texttt{euro} which maps to \textbackslash \texttt{officialeuro} but can be altered using a package option.

\subsection{And the rest of the World}

\footnotetext[1]{This version of the dollar sign with two vertical lines is called the cifrão. Amounts are generally written so that it serves as the decimal separator, such as 20\textdollaroldstyle00 for 20 escudos.}

\medskip

The \texttt{mathdesign} package redefines \textbackslash \texttt{texteuro} to be compatible with these fonts: \textit{Utopia}, \textit{Charter} or \textit{Garamond}.

\medskip

And then there is the \texttt{marvosym} package which has these symbols:

\medskip

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{2.5cm} p{4cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{\LaTeX}  \\
                & \textbf{Use} \\

            & Obsolete symbol for the German pfennig \\
\EUR        & \textbackslash \texttt{EUR} \\
\EURcr      & \textbackslash \texttt{EURcr} \\
            & Euro compatible with \textit{Courier}. \\
\EURdig     & \textbackslash \texttt{EURdig} \\

\EyesDollar & \textbackslash \texttt{EyesDollar} \\
\Shilling   & \textbackslash \texttt{Shilling}\footnotemark[3] \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In conclusion, \LaTeX\ caters for all common, and some not so common, currency symbols. Unicode, however, has a few additional ones, and is far better documented.  $\blacksquare$

\footnotetext[3]{This symbol resembles a beta ($\beta$) but I belive it to be more akin to the German Eszett (\ss). It is possibly a symbol for the schilling, the pre-euro currency of Austria.}

\section{Wikibooks}

\AUTHOR{Jonathan Webley}

\subsection{Wikis}
Wikis are the backbone of Web 2.0 - collaborative websites with dynamic, user-driven content.

The Wikimedia Foundation hosts many wiki projects in many languages using its MediaWiki application. These wikis all have the same, simple ethos - information is free. Notoriously, any anonymous amateur can contribute and there is no guarantee that information is either correct, complete or legal. 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.38\textwidth]{Wikipedia.png}
\end{center}

\medskip

But surprisingly the concept works and the flagship project, Wikipedia, is a huge success. There are many editors making small contributions and a few who spend hours and hours editing. Minor errors are easily fixed, articles are continually kept up to date, and an army of volunteers check for vandalism and enforce standards. Copyright issues are dealt with, facts are checked and malicious contributors blocked. Wikipedia has readable and useful articles covering many more topics and in more depth than any paper encyclop\ae dia.

\subsection{\LaTeX\ and MediaWiki}
The MediaWiki software supports \LaTeX. It uses a limited subset of \AmS-\LaTeX\ generating either PNG images or simple HTML mark-up, depending on user preferences and the complexity of the expression.

In MediaWiki, \LaTeX\ is enclosed within the tags \texttt{<math>} and \texttt{</math>}; there is a button to insert these into the edit box. So a simple equation, such as Euler's formula, would be entered as
\begin{center}
\texttt{<math>e\^\{i\textbackslash pi\} + 1 = 0</math>}
\end{center}

And should appear on screen as:
\[
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
\]

Maxwell's equations provide an example requiring aligned equations, and are entered as:

\medskip

\noindent \texttt{<math> \\
\textbackslash begin\{align\} \\
\textbackslash nabla \textbackslash cdot \textbackslash mathbf\{D\} \&= \textbackslash rho\_f \textbackslash \textbackslash \\
\textbackslash nabla \textbackslash cdot \textbackslash mathbf\{B\} \&= 0 \textbackslash \textbackslash \\
\textbackslash nabla \textbackslash times \textbackslash mathbf\{E\} \&= \\
        -\textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash partial \textbackslash mathbf\{B\}\} \{\textbackslash partial t\} \textbackslash \textbackslash \\ 
\textbackslash nabla \textbackslash times \textbackslash mathbf\{H\} \&= \textbackslash mathbf\{J\}\_f + \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash partial \textbackslash mathbf\{D\}\} \{\textbackslash partial t\} \\
\textbackslash end\{align\} \\
</math>}

\medskip

And these appear as:
\begin{align*}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} &= \rho_f \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0 \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} &= -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t} \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{H} &= \mathbf{J}_f + \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}} {\partial t}
\end{align*}

Equations are not automatically numbered, and the \texttt{align*} environment is neither available nor required.

\subsection{Wikibooks}
Wikipedia has several sister projects and Wikibooks is one of the more useful of these. Whereas Wikipedia hosts many encyclop\ae dic articles, Wikibooks hosts fewer, longer articles or books, with a more connected narrative and chapters that would normally be read in order. Each Wikibook aims to be a definitive reference work -- though few achieve this.

The Wikipedia article on \LaTeX\ is short and covers only a few subjects such as the history of \LaTeX\ and licensing issues. But in Wikibooks, the \LaTeX\ book has over 30 chapters (or pages) and appendices. Some of these are substantital and considered ``complete'', others are bare stubs. The chapters cover various subjects including tables, graphics, indexing and maths environments. There is a small index and a glossary and contains material both for the beginner and the expert. Wikipedia concentrates on the \textit{why} and Wikibooks on the \textit{how}.

Other sister projects include Wiktionary, a dictionary, which ultimately aims to define all words in all languages. Wikiversity is a ``university'', which aims to have learning resources such as courses and tests, but has only a limited amount of material on \LaTeX.

\subsection{Featured Book}
The Wikibook on \LaTeX\ is a featured book. Out of the thousands of Wikibooks, less than 70 are featured. A random selection of featured books appears on the front page of Wikibooks. Featured books have an exceptionally high quality, lots of content and are well-formatted. \LaTeX\ was nominated in April 2007, garnered seven supporting votes and achieved featured status in May 2007.

The \LaTeX\ book is listed as the 4\textsuperscript{th} most popular Wikibook. Books are ranked by their most popular page, which for \LaTeX\ is the front page -- the contents page. This page averaged over 1000 hits per day over a sample period in 2008. Several other pages (or chapters) from this book also made it into the top 20.

Wikibooks, unlike most of the other wiki projects, has this year introduced reviewed pages. Reviewing assesses pages with regard to readability, accuracy and depth. A reviewed page is considered to be a stable version of that page. Reviewing can only be carried out by ``editors''. Editor status is automatically granted to contributors who have met various criteria such as having made sufficient edits and having a confirmed email address. All pages need to be reviewed, and re-reviewed if changed. In the \LaTeX\ Wikibook many pages still require to be reviewed.

\subsection{Conclusion}
All wiki content must be seen as a work-in-progress. If you don't like it - you can fix it or improve it or start again from scratch. The \LaTeX\ Wikibook has several small chapters which need to be expanded; other chapters need to be enhanced, and more chapters could easily be added. There also two very short and incomplete Wikibooks on \TeX.

In conclusion, the \LaTeX\ Wikibook is a reasonably good online resource, and one that can only get better, especially with our support.
