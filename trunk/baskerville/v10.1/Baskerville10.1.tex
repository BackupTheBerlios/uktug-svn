\section{Editorial}
Welcome to the revived \BK. \BK\ was for many years the journal of UK-TUG and archived copies are available through our web-site. The UK-TUG committee have decided to start anew publication of \BK\ and I have been co-opted onto the committee as editor. This is the first new issue. Since the purpose of \TeX\ is to produce ``marks on paper'' \BK\ has been printed and posted out; though all issues will also be available on the web.

The journal is named after a serif typeface designed in 1757 by John Baskerville. Previous issues of \BK\ used the Baskerville font but this issue uses the default \textit{Computer Modern} font.

This particular issue is somewhat light in content. The quality of future issues will depend on \textit{you}, the membership of UK-TUG. I do not intent to create all the content myself, and welcome contributions on matters relevant to \TeX\ or UK-TUG.

I think that a newsletter is central to the well-being of a user group such as ours, and I look forwards to hearing your comments on this issue.

\section{Events}
\subsection{Euro\TeX\ 2009}
Euro\TeX\ 2009 takes place this year in the Hague, the Netherlands, on 31 August through 4 September 2009, and the conference will focus on educational uses of \TeX, such as manuals, presentations and teaching materials. The conference will be in English.

The fee for UK-TUG members is \euro350, which includes everything except the excursion day (which costs \euro75). In particular it includes accommodation and meals.

The official website is \href{http://www.ntg.nl/EuroTeX2009/index.html}{www.ntg.nl/EuroTeX2009}.

\subsection{Bacho\TeX\ 2009}
Bacho\TeX\ 2009 is the XVIIth Polish \TeX\ Users Group Conference.

As usual it will be held at the traditional \TeX ies' and GUST meeting place, Bachotek near Brodnica, in the north-east of Poland, from 29 April until 3 May 2009 inclusive.

The conference aims to get a glimpse of the future, and the title is:
\begin{center} ``\textit{\TeX: at a turning point, or at the crossroads?}'' \end{center}

The community is putting a lot of effort and thought into possible strategies for promoting and developing \TeX\ and related products for the foreseeable future, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item \TeX\, and \TeX-based engines
\item enhanced graphics engines
\item new or improved macro packages
\item user interfaces
\item new fonts
\end{itemize}

Work progresses in many different directions, and thus there is clearly hope for an ever better future, even though the more pessimistic may wonder whether \TeX\ represents an evolutionary dead-end.

In this context the feedback between users and developers of new tools and engines is immensely important -- it might decide whether within a few years we will be looking back at today as a successful turning point or as a bad decision at the crossroads of \TeX's history.

Conference themes or mottos often have little impact on submissions.
% Some say that they have never believed that conference themes or mottos have any impact on submissions anyway. 
The organisers of Bacho\TeX\ think otherwise. There is no restriction on the content of presentations but those that are user-centric and oriented towards the future of \TeX\ with special emphasis on the needs, hopes and dangers are preferred.

Proposals (abstracts) should be e-mailed to the Program Committee: \href{mailto:papers-2009@gust.org.pl}{papers-2009@gust.org.pl}. Bogus\l{}aw Jackowski has been appointmed chairman.

Especially welcome are proposals for \TeX-related tutorials or introductions. Contact the organisers if you have suggestions for tutorials or workshops by others than yourself or about specific topics.

The deadline for abstracts and other proposals is 8 March. The deadline for final papers will soon be published at the conference web site: \href{http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/2009/main-en.html?set_language=en}{www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2009}

Exhausted \TeX ies will get a chance to recover their intellectual powers during nightly musical sessions, usually at a bonfire. Participate by bringing your own instruments (and voices)! Nature fans will have the opportunity to enjoy the unspoiled features of the Bachotek lake and surrounding woods. The conference could also be a family event -- the conference site is an enclosed area with a safe and attractive playing ground for children and parents alike.

\vspace{2em}
\noindent \textbf{Call for \TeX\ Pearls} \\
The organisers are seeking to continue the tradition of ``The Pearls of \TeX\ Programming''.
Here, briefly, is what is wanted:
\begin{itemize}
\item short \TeX, MF or MP macro(s)
\item results must be useful, and the solution not obvious
\item easy to explain:  10 minutes at most
\end{itemize}

If you have something that fits the bill, please consider submitting a proposal. If you know of somebody's work that does the same, please let us know, and we will contact that person.  Other details and previously collected Pearls can be found at 
\href{http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/pearls/}{www.gust.org.pl/projects/pearls}

% \textbf{Currency Symbols} \\

\section{Currency Symbols in \LaTeX}
Standard keyboards contain the dollar sign (\$), which, of course, is a special symbol in \TeX, so needs to be prefaced with a backslash or oblique: \textbackslash \$. This symbol works properly in both text mode and math mode.

Keyboards also have a pound sign (£), the use of which requires the package \texttt{inputenc}. Additionally, there is a standard command \textbackslash \texttt{pounds}, which renders as \pounds. This symbol works properly in both text mode and math mode.

Additionally, standard \LaTeX\ contains two commands for these signs:

\textbackslash \texttt{textdollar} which renders as \textdollar, and

\textbackslash \texttt{textsterling} which renders as \textsterling.

\medskip

The euro has its own package, \texttt{eurosym}, which contains these commands:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l }
\toprule
\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{\LaTeX}  \\
\midrule
\geneuro        & \textbackslash \texttt{geneuro} \\
\geneuronarrow  & \textbackslash \texttt{geneuronarrow} \\
\geneurowide    & \textbackslash \texttt{geneurowide} \\
\officialeuro   & \textbackslash \texttt{officialeuro} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
All of these symbols are generated using the ``C'' character of the current body font. The package also contains the command \textbackslash \texttt{euro} which maps to \textbackslash \texttt{officialeuro} but can be altered using a package option.

% --------------------------------------------------------
% Change footnote marker to symbols instead of numbers.
%\renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\fnsymbol{footnote}}
% --------------------------------------------------------

The \texttt{textcomp} package includes these symbols:

\medskip

The \texttt{mathdesign} package redefines \textbackslash \texttt{texteuro} to be compatible with these fonts: \textit{Utopia}, \textit{Charter} or \textit{Garamond}.

\medskip

And then there is the \texttt{marvosym} package which has these symbols:

\medskip

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l }
\toprule
\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{\LaTeX}  \\
                & \textbf{Use} \\
\midrule
\Denarius   & \textbackslash \texttt{Denarius}\footnotemark[2] \\
            & Obsolete symbol for the German pfennig \\
\EUR        & \textbackslash \texttt{EUR} \\
\EURcr      & \textbackslash \texttt{EURcr} \\
            & Euro compatible with \textit{Courier}. \\
\EURdig     & \textbackslash \texttt{EURdig} \\
            & Euro compatible with \texttt{marvosym} digits. \\
\EURhv      & \textbackslash \texttt{EURhv} \\
            & Euro compatible with \textit{Helvetica}. \\
\EURtm      & \textbackslash \texttt{EURtm} \\
            & Euro compatible with \textit{Times} \textit{Roman}. \\
\EyesDollar & \textbackslash \texttt{EyesDollar} \\
\Shilling   & \textbackslash \texttt{Shilling}\footnotemark[3] \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In conclusion, \LaTeX\ caters for all common, and some not so common, currency symbols. Unicode, however, has a few additional ones, and is far better documented.
